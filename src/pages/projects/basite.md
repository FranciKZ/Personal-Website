## Brewed Awakening Vermilion Website

Worked with a local coffee shop to design and implement a web application to help expand their online presence. For easy management the application integrates entirely with their Square account. The front end consisted of a user facing ecommerce application and a administrator portal. Both were developed using React, Redux, and Typescript. The backend is a NodeJS RESTful API. Basic information is stored in a MongoDB database hosted on MongoDB Atlas. It was deployed using Docker to a AWS EC2 instance with NGINX acting as a reverse-proxy.
